Return Policy – Antigravity Electronics

1. General Return Window

We offer a 7-day return window from the date of delivery for most products. 
This means:
- You can request a return within 7 calendar days after the product is marked as delivered.
- After 7 days, the order is considered outside the return window and is not eligible for return, except in special cases such as serious defects.

2. Conditions for Return

To be eligible for a return:
- The product should be in good condition, with no physical damage caused by misuse.
- Wherever possible, the original box, accessories, and invoice should be available.
- For headphones, hygiene and usage conditions may apply. Excessively used or damaged items may be rejected.

3. Eligible Categories

In this demo store:
- Laptops: eligible for return within 7 days from delivery, subject to inspection.
- Headphones: eligible for return within 7 days from delivery, subject to inspection.

4. Non-Returnable Situations

A return request may be rejected in cases such as:
- The request is raised after the 7-day return window.
- The product is damaged due to misuse, accidental damage, or unauthorized repair.
- Missing major accessories or serial number tampering.

5. Return Process

Typical steps:
1. Customer raises a return request with the order ID (for example, ORD1001).
2. Basic eligibility is checked based on the delivery date and status.
3. If eligible, the product is picked up or dropped off as per instructions.
4. After the product is inspected and approved, refund processing starts.

6. Relationship with Refunds

In our system logic:
- Refunds are only processed if the order is eligible for return.
- If an order is outside the 7-day return window, it is not eligible for a refund based on this policy.

Note: This policy is part of a demo ecommerce RAG system, and the timelines align with the tools used in the backend (for example, a 7-day eligibility check based on delivery_date).
