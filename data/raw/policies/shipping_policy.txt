Shipping Policy – Antigravity Electronics

1. Shipping Regions

For this demo system, we assume shipping within India to serviceable pin codes. 
Real logistics partners and pin code checks are not implemented, but the assistant can talk about “standard shipping within India”.

2. Delivery Timelines

Typical delivery estimates:
- Standard shipping: 3–7 business days after the order is shipped.
- In some cases, remote locations may take slightly longer.

The exact delivery date shown in the order (for example, 2025-12-03) is considered the official delivery date for return and warranty calculations.

3. Shipping Charges

For the purpose of this demo:
- We can assume “free standard shipping” on most orders.
- The assistant may mention that shipping is generally free, unless otherwise specified.

4. Order Status Stages

Common order statuses used by our tools:
- processing: the order has been placed and is being prepared.
- shipped: the order has left the warehouse and is in transit.
- delivered: the order has reached the customer (this date is used for return and warranty calculations).

5. Tracking Orders

Customers can ask:
- “Where is my order ORD1002?”
- “What is the status of my order ORD1001?”

The system will use the internal order data to report:
- Current status (processing, shipped, delivered)
- Expected or actual delivery date

6. Relationship to Return and Warranty

- The delivery_date field from the order is used for:
  - Calculating the 7-day return window.
  - Calculating the warranty period (for example, 365 days for laptops, 180 days for headphones in this demo).

This policy is part of the documentation used by the RAG assistant for ecommerce support.
