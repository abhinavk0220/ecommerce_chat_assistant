General FAQ – Antigravity Electronics

Q1: What products do you sell?
A1: We currently focus on a small catalog of electronics, mainly:
    - Laptops for students, professionals, and business users
    - Wireless headphones, including noise-cancelling and bass-focused models

Q2: How do I track my order?
A2: You can track your order by using your order ID in the format ORD1234.
    For example, you can ask the assistant:
    - “Where is my order ORD1002?”
    - “What is the status of ORD1001?”
    The assistant will respond with the current status and the expected or actual delivery date.

Q3: What is your return policy?
A3: We offer a 7-day return window from the date of delivery for eligible products such as laptops and headphones.
    The product should be in good condition and may be subject to inspection.
    For more details, see the Return Policy document.

Q4: How long is the warranty on products?
A4: In this demo:
    - Laptops: typically 1-year manufacturer-like warranty (365 days from delivery).
    - Headphones: typically 6-month warranty (around 180 days from delivery).
    Warranty calculations are based on the delivery_date stored in the system.

Q5: How long do refunds take?
A5: Once a return has been approved and the product is received and inspected,
    refunds are usually processed within 5–7 business days to the original payment method.

Q6: Can I cancel my order?
A6: As this is a demo system, formal cancellation flows are not implemented.
    However, you can imagine:
    - Cancellation is possible while the order is still in “processing” status.
    - Once an order is “shipped” or “delivered”, it can no longer be cancelled but may be eligible for return.

Q7: How can I contact support?
A7: In a real system, you would contact support via email, phone, or chat.
    In this demo, the AI assistant is the primary interface for support queries regarding orders, products, returns, refunds, and troubleshooting.

Q8: Are these real orders and products?
A8: No. This is a demo / educational system.
    The orders, products, and policies are synthetic examples created to test a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant for ecommerce support.
